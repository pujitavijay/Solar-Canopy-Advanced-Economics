# Solar Parking Canopy Implementation and Business Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing a solar parking canopy in Parking Lot 64 at the university. The aim is to promote environmentally responsible behaviors and address the increasing demand for clean energy. The solar canopy will power both the recreation center and the core building while providing shade for parked cars. Additionally, a bank of electric car chargers will be installed to support the growing number of staff and faculty with electric vehicles.

## Objectives
- **Environmentally Responsible Behavior**: Encourage the use of clean energy and reduce carbon footprint.
- **Clean Energy**: Utilize solar energy to power key university buildings.
- **Vehicle Charging**: Facilitate the transition to electric vehicles by providing charging stations.
- **Dual Purpose**: The solar canopy will serve both as an energy source and as a shade provider for parked cars.

## Implementation
- **Solar Parking Canopy**: Installed in Parking Lot 64 to generate solar power.
- **Electric Car Chargers**: A bank of chargers will be set up to accommodate electric vehicles.
- **Power Supply**: The generated solar energy will be used to power the recreation center and the core building.

## Business Analysis Model
- **Tool Used**: Microsoft Excel
- **Purpose**: To perform business analysis, including cost-benefit analysis, ROI calculations, and feasibility studies related to the solar parking canopy and electric vehicle chargers.
